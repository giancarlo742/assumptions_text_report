As part of company policy, all hours paid under the general physician consulting contract are considered general payments, as the hours incurred are not performed under a research-specific contract.- Sign-in Sheet review: All events with potential covered recipients are required to have a sign-in sheet that details the attendee's name, credentials, and any NPI/license if applicable. The coordinator of the event manages the sign-in sheet and attendee count, and we utilize that sheet as the basis for all covered recipient review.- Expensify Review: The reimbursements are reviewed individually through Expensify by multiple individuals. We rely on the information provided by the employee and provide adequate training to ensure that each reimbursed employee is aware of covered recipients and transparency reporting. In the review of the expense reports, we ask questions relating to transparency reporting when discrepancies are identified.- Reporting Date: For the transfer of goods (Meals, flights, etc.) we report based on the date that the goods were transferred. For the payment of a service performed, we report based on the date that the service was paid regardless of the date of the service, as the payment date reflects the date there was a transfer of value.- Fellows/Students: Some fellows/students were reported if state license information matched successfully against CMS data.

To establish the current value per ownership unit of SN Holdings we utilized the total enterprise valuation as determined by the majority owner (a private equity firm) as part of their standard portfolio valuation process. A component of the individual unit valuation is an accrued preferred return; thus, individual owner valuations vary slightly based upon the date the ownership was purchased. The December 31, 2023 per unit valuation was $2.90 per unit.The majority of the physician-owners of SN Holdings, LLC hold their interest through their ownership in a separate investment entity (generally an LLC) or directly by their practice.  For each investment entity or physician practice that invested in Specialty Networks, we determined the individual physicians' respective investments by dividing the total investment by the number of total owners of such practice, unless we had information to the contrary with respect to any ownership percentages.  We calculated the dollar amount invested for physicians who received units or partial units by joining the practice, or who received additional units or partial units upon resignation of another owner, by multiplying the amount of ownership interest received by that physician (for example, 1 unit or .5 units) by the current value of the ownership interest (which was calculated based on the methodology above).

S 403.908(c)(4), applicable manufacturers are required to identify their status as ""physician-owned distributorships"" when registering or recertifying. The regulations broadly defined a ""physician-owned distributorship"" as including an applicable manufacturer that meets at least one of the following two conditions: (1) has a minimum of 5% direct or indirect ownership or investment interest held by a physician or a physician's immediate family member; or (2) a physician or a physician's immediate family member receives compensation from the applicable manufacturer in the form of ""a commission, return on investment, profit sharing, profit distribution, or other remuneration directly or indirectly derived from the sale or distribution of devices by the applicable manufacturer."" 42 C.F.R. S 403.902. Contego Medical does not consider itself to be a ""physician-owned distributorship"" as such term has historically been defined by other enforcement agencies. See, e.g., OIG Special Fraud Alert: Physician-Owned Entities (Mar. 26, 2013) (defining a ""physician-owned distributorship"" as ""any physician-owned entity that derives revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices and includes physician-owned entities that purport to design or manufacture, typically under contractual arrangements, their own medical devices or instrumentation""). Contego Medical also does not view its business as presenting the ""physician-owned distributorship"" risks for which the government has had long-held concerns.However, Contego Medical's physician-founder and CEO does hold a 5% or greater ownership interest in the company. Accordingly, Contego Medical has identified itself as a ""physician-owned distributorship"" solely for purposes of its CY 2023 Open Payments reporting."
1E+11,"Spinal Simplicity, LLC ",No ,No ,Yes ,No ,No ,No ,No ,0,0,1020,0,0,0,0,3,519.46,0,"This document is submitted by Spinal Simplicity, LLC (the ""Company"") under 42 C.F.R.  403.908(f) for its Open Payments reporting period ending on December 31, 2023.1. The value of the Company's reportable ownership or investment interests are based on a December 31, 2023 valuation analysis report, that was completed on March 15, 2024, of the common units in the Company as outlined under Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 718 performed by an independent valuation firm (the ""Independent Valuation""). 2. This Independent Valuation was based on the valuation firm's independent review and analysis of historical and financial data provided by the Company, an estimation of value based on several factors relevant to the valuation of the Company's ownership and investment interests, and other, additional factors including, without limitation, the closely-held nature of the Company, a minority interest discount, lack of marketability, and the lengthy, anticipated holding period for units (i.e., time to a potential liquidity event).3. The methodologies utilized by the valuation firm in the Independent Valuation has resulted in a lower per unit price of the Company's reportable ownership and investment interest in 2023 as compared to prior years. For example, in 2023, as compared to prior reporting years, the Company's reportable ownership and investment interests were determined based on the Independent Valuation, which utilized an option pricing model to allocate the equity value across the Company's capitalization structure based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing structure, which relied upon the following inputs: (a) underlying security price; (b) expected term; (c) volatility; and (d) risk-free rate. This methodology was independently evaluated and selected by the valuation firm for the Company's valuation. 4. The Company's reportable ownership and investment interests are also premised upon the following assumptions and methods: a. For each ownership or investment interest acquired by a covered recipient prior to 2023 through a financial investment, the value of the interest is reported as the ""Value of Interest"" based on the Independent Valuation;  b. For each ownership or investment interest that was acquired by a covered recipient in 2023 through a financial investment, the value of the interest is reported as the ""Dollar Amount Invested"" based on the Independent Valuation;  c. For each ownership or investment interest earned by a covered recipient prior to 2023 as compensation under a consulting agreement, the value of the interest is reported as the ""Dollar Amount Invested"" based on the Independent Valuation to the extent the interest became fully-vested for the covered recipient;  d. For each ownership or investment interest earned by a covered recipient in 2023 as compensation under a consulting agreement, the value of the interest is reported as the ""Value of Interest"" based on the Independent Valuation as general payment consulting fees for the provision of consulting services, and is reported as of the date the interest became fully-vested for the covered recipient. 5. Of the total units acquired through a financial investment by covered recipients for which the Company has submitted an OII record in 2023, approximately 92.46% of the units were purchased by a covered recipient that does not use, prescribe nor implant the Company's medical devices. 6. Of the total units owned by covered recipients for which the Company has submitted an OII record in 2023, four records concern Company employees that are immediate family members of physicians that do not use, prescribe nor implant the Company's medical devices, and one of the covered recipients is a physician from whom the Company purchased a patent with equity units. The attribution rules of the Open Payments regulations require these to be reported. 7. The ownership or investment interests earned by a covered recipient as compensation for consulting services are based upon the Company's significant need for services, the bona fide provision of those services, and a detailed written agreement between the Company and the covered recipient. The services provided by the covered recipients include, without limitation, participation on the Company's Medical Advisory Board; the provision of advice to the Company relating to its products, devices and instrumentation; the provision of advice relating to the development, improvement, and variations of the Company's devices; the provision of guidance on research, clinical study design, publication, physician training, peer education; and the provision of other reasonable services, including clinical study involvement."

Following this, in January 2024, Medline hired a new Chief Compliance Officer. Following these developments, Medline's Compliance and Tax Department reviewed the company's historical Open Payments reporting practices and made updates to the company's internal assumptions with respect to reporting of ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members in Medline.  Physician-Owned Distributorship Status Medline understands that, consistent with 42 C.F.R. 403.908(c)(4), applicable manufacturers are required to identify their status as ""physician-owned distributorships"" when registering or recertifying. The regulations broadly defined a ""physician-owned distributorship"" as including an applicable manufacturer that meets at least one of the following two conditions: (1) has a minimum of 5% direct or indirect ownership or investment interest held by a physician or a physician's immediate family member; or (2) a physician or a physician's immediate family member receives compensation from the applicable manufacturer in the form of ""a commission, return on investment, profit sharing, profit distribution, or other remuneration directly or indirectly derived from the sale or distribution of devices by the applicable manufacturer."" 42 C.F.R. 403.902. Medline does not consider itself to be a ""physician-owned distributorship"" as such term has historically been defined by other enforcement agencies. See, e.g., OIG Special Fraud Alert: Physician-Owned Entities (Mar. 26, 2013) (defining a ""physician-owned distributorship"" as ""any physician-owned entity that derives revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices and includes physician-owned entities that purport to design or manufacture, typically under contractual arrangements, their own medical devices or instrumentation""). Medline also does not view its business as presenting the ""physician-owned distributorship"" risks for which the government has had long-held concerns.While no physicians or immediate family members of physicians hold a 5% or greater direct or indirect ownership or investment interest in Medline, Medline does make royalty payments to certain physicians, as reflected in its current and historic Open Payments reports. Accordingly, because such payments could arguably be ""remuneration . . . indirectly derived from the sale or distribution of devices,"" Medline has identified itself as a ""physician-owned distributorship"" solely for purposes of its CY 2023 Open Payments reporting."

Novo Nordisk A/S, Novo Nordisk Healthcare AG, and Novo Nordisk Inc., are Paragraph 1 manufacturers, and Novo Nordisk Research Center Seattle, Inc. is a Paragraph 2 manufacturer. INDIRECT PAYMENTS As a general matter, except as otherwise required under the special rules for reporting research payments, contracts with institutions for the services of named physicians were reported in the names of the physicians and or the relevant teaching hospitals, where applicable, unless the contracted institution confirmed no pass-through payment to the physician or teaching hospital.PAYMENT DATE Payments and transfers of value related to consulting, advisory boards, and speaker programs were reported using the meeting date as the date of payment. Payments related to in office meals were reported using the transaction date. Transfers of value related to clinical trials, e.g., supplies and equipment, were generally reported based on date of shipment. MEALS Multiple meals provided during the course of an activity, particularly multi-day events, may be reported as a single transfer of value. RESEARCH As a general matter, the report includes investigator fees, site specific expenses, fees, payments or transfers of value via CROs, equipment, ancillary supplies, local IRB fees, and commercially available drug provided for investigator sponsored studies. The report includes the name of the contractual entity as the entity receiving the transfer of value.MATCHING VALIDATION To help ensure covered recipient identity matching, where possible, the physician and non-physician identifiers reported, including state license, number, name, etc. match those as listed in the CMS VPL and the NPPL. There are cases where the identifiers included in the VPL for physicians and NPPL for non-physicians are inconsistent with information the company maintains for the individuals. To help ensure that the records the company submits are accepted by the Open Payments system, the company has reported physician identifiers listed in the VPL and non-physician identifiers as listed in the NPPL, even in cases where the company's data is inconsistent with the information in the VPL and NPPL.  In addition, there is a small number of covered recipients to whom we provided reportable payments and transfers of value and for whom the Open Payments system was unable to match their identities. The Open Payments system does not permit submission of those records that cannot pass matching validation. We have deleted those records from our submission and documented the matching attempts in our records. DATA LIMITATIONS This submission includes data maintained in the company's systems as of March 15, 2024, that has been processed in accordance with applicable policies and procedures, and that has been validated as representing reportable payments or transfers of value provided to covered recipients during the period January 1 to December 31, 2023.  The March 15, 2024, data cutoff date is necessary to provide sufficient time to complete the company's process for verifying the accuracy and completeness of the submission.  Any data that may enter the company's systems after March 15, 2024, that reflects interactions during the reporting period, will be separately analyzed and validated to assess whether it impacts this submission.ADDITONAL ATTESTATION PRIOR TO MARCH 31 DEADLINE: Some additional PY 2023 data was received after the company's data cutoff date of March 15, 2024, however, the company has been able to process it and prepare it for timely submission and attestation prior to the March 31st deadline."

Please note that, as of March 2023, Stimwave ceased to meet the definition of an ""Applicable Manufacturer"" and is no longer considered a ""Reporting Entity"" under the CMS Open Payments Program. Stimwave filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2022 and sold substantially all of its assets to Curonix LLC in October 2022. Stimwave ceased all business activities at that time, other than minimal activities related to its bankruptcy, liquidation, and winding up and the Curonix acquisition. Stimwave is now under the exclusive control of Province, LLC in its capacity as the Liquidating Trustee (the ""Liquidating Trustee"") for the SWTI (Stimwave) Liquidating Trust (the ""Liquidating Trust""), which is currently in the midst of liquidating Stimwave pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation (the ""Plan of Liquidation"") that was approved by the bankruptcy court on March 21, 2023. Under the Plan of Liquidation, substantially all of Stimwave's remaining assets - comprised primarily of the bankruptcy sale proceeds - were transferred to the Liquidating Trust for administration, and the Liquidating Trustee was expressly designated by court order as Stimwave's sole shareholder, interest holder, officer, director, and manager.The Plan of Liquidation states that, when the Plan became effective, all Stimwave stock was cancelled and the Liquidating Trustee became Stimwave's sole stockholder. As a result of this mass stock cancellation, all physicians previously reported in Open Payments as physician owners of Stimwave ceased to own any Stimwave stock. Stimwave's 2023 Open Payments submission nevertheless identifies one physician who, under the Plan of Liquidation, received junior interests in Stimwave's Liquidating Trust in exchange for his cancelled Stimwave stock, even though these junior interests in the Liquidating Trust may not technically constitute reportable ownership or investment interests. Because of Stimwave's ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, it has not yet been determined whether this physician will ultimately receive any proceeds from the Liquidating Trust when the liquidation is completed. Therefore, for purposes of this report, ""$0.01"" is being reported as a placeholder for the ""Value of Interest"" for this junior interest in the Liquidating Trust; the actual value of this junior interest may end up being more or less than $0.01 once it is determined whether the physician will receive any proceeds from the Liquidating Trust."

COP, which operates in the United States, is a provider of dental products, including prescription dental products.  This year is the first year in which COP is filing an Open Payments report.  When the Sunshine Act was enacted, COP understood that withdrawing from the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program would resolve any reporting obligation under the law because withdrawal would mean that payment was not available for COP's products.  More recently, however, COP became aware that there is limited reimbursement for its products primarily from managed Medicare and Medicaid plans.  COP determined that it therefore is subject to the Sunshine Act's reporting requirements.As a result of COP's determination that it is subject to reporting, COP is implementing several process improvements to ensure accurate and ongoing Open Payments reports, including the following: 1. Educating Company leadership on the Company's reporting obligation and the systems that will need to be enhanced to facilitate compliance with those reporting obligations;2. Leveraging and enhancing current systems for capturing spend to generate reportable transfers of value;3. Engaging an experienced third-party vendor to assist the Company with reporting;4. Implementing policies on Sunshine Reporting; and5. Providing formal training to relevant personnel regarding the Company's reporting obligations and the Company's policies, processes, and systems for accurately capturing reportable information.

Centralized laboratory or other services and supplies provided by a vendor contracted by or on behalf of Amgen, or provided by Amgen itself, to facilitate the conduct of research and/or provided directly to study subjects, and not specific to a particular clinical site, are not considered TOVs to study site entity CRs or PI CRs. 8. Amgen values study drug and reportable products and materials using WAC, or if Amgen purchased the material, as the cost of acquiring the material. For clinical study drug where cost is not available, Amgen uses the Customs value. 9. Medical writing TOVs are calculated by dividing amount equally among all authors. 10. Research and Clinical Trial cash payments returned in a different year than the original payment are not reconciled. 11. Publication costs unrelated to medical writing services, such as publication fees, are not considered a TOV. 12.

Amgen reports TOVs which are available to Amgen at the time of reporting, except TOVs omitted due to CMS system limitations (including unvalidated or unmatched records) or directions. Amgen maintains documentation of records rejected by the CMS system. It is also possible that certain errors and omissions may exist due to various circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, inadvertent errors, delays in receipt of the data, missing or irretrievable data, or data omitted by vendors or other necessary sources of information. Updates to Amgen's report may become necessary as additional information becomes available. Thus, Amgen expects to attest to some records after the deadline, as new data for the reporting period becomes available, disputes are resolved, and corrections to previously submitted data are made. 16. Amgen has no control over changes to reports implemented by CMS directly prior to posting on its website. 17.

This methodology continued until the termination of the TSA. 2019 Otezla-related records are disclosed with Celgene's Otezla NDC number ""59572-631-06"" as Amgen did not have an Otezla NDC during 2019. Beginning in 2020, Otezla-related records are disclosed with Amgen's Otezla NDC number ""55513-137-60"". 18. Amgen markets some biologics in presentations where the drug is packaged in combination with a delivery device. These combination products have unique NDC numbers. Where a covered biologic is identified, Open Payments does not allow submission of both an NDC and a device ID. Per guidance from the CMS Help Desk, only the NDC is reported for covered biologics that are packed in combination with delivery devices. 19. Amgen acquired ChemoCentryx, Inc. on October 20, 2022. The acquisition included the drug product TAVNEOS (avacopan), the first ChemoCentryx product to receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (in October 2021). As per CMS guidance, an entity has a grace period of 180 days following its product becoming ""covered"" to begin complying with the data collection and reporting requirements. Therefore, the first CMS submission took place on March 31, 2023, for the in-scope 2022 calendar year based TOVs collected from ChemoCentryx legacy source systems or provided by its contracted third parties. TAVNEOS-related records are disclosed with NDC number ""73556-168-01"". These TOVs will be submitted under Amgen's CMS Manufacturer ID. 20. Amgen acquired Horizon Therapeutics plc on October 6, 2023.  Horizon data for all covered TOV 2023 transactions involving legacy Horizon products were collected and  disclosed in accordance with Horizon's processes and procedures under Horizon's CMS Manufacturer ID.  Beginning in March 2025, TOV involving legacy Horizon products will be reported by Amgen in accordance with Amgen's processes and procedures under Amgen's CMS Manufacturer ID.  21.  Amgen funding of sponsorships or other engagements providing laboratory test services to individuals for education or disease state awareness purposes, where Amgen does not have knowledge of the identity of the recipients of the testing (e.g., for privacy or contractual reasons), are not considered a reportable TOV."

We have made a good faith effort to capture and report payments and transfers of value provided to covered recipients completely and accurately. However, the reporting requirements are complex and there are known and unknown limitations associated with our data collection and reporting processes. If the company identifies additional data relevant to this reporting period after submission, we will submit the data to CMS. We have a team dedicated to data collection, reporting, and quality assurance. We have continued to work with our vendor to improve our HCP master database and aggregate spend reporting system. We have continued to refine our systems and processes to ensure accuracy. We have worked closely with legal counsel to ensure our interpretations are reasonable. We have established policies and supporting resources for Sunshine requirements and continued to educate our employees. Our HCP-facing employees and non-employee sales agents have received mandatory trainings, and managers have completed certifications. We have performed internal assessment of data collection and reporting processes and controls to ensure full compliance. Notwithstanding our good faith efforts, there are known and unknown risks that affect the accuracy and completeness of our data. Some examples of risks are noted below. Some of our processes are manual using Excel based templates. These manual processes are prone to human errors. In order to mitigate the risk, we have implemented controls including review, validation checks, and sub-certifications. We use a large number of independent sales agents. To address the potential risk, we have implemented a mobile application for them to capture their spend and additional controls including training and communication as well as sub-certifications. As a global company, we have global meetings that involve US HCPs. However, our non-US businesses are managed separately and use different systems. They report payments and transfers of value provided to US HCPs through a manual process. We have implemented training, documented procedures, and sub-certifications to address the potential risks in this process. There are some transactions that failed the matching validation process due to certain limitations. For example, a physician is a student in NPPES but we confirmed the physician is a practicing physician. Consistent with the most recent guidance received from CMS, we have worked with the CMS Help Desk diligently to resolve the issues which caused the transactions to fail the matching validation process. If they still remain unresolved, we have removed the transactions in question from the data submission.  We will re-submit these transactions in the following calendar year for good faith effort. Additionally, some of our 2023 records submitted would have failed because CMS is now validating Biological products against the NDC and our Biological products do not have an NDC code as not all Biological products are listed in the NDC Directory. We have contacted the CMS Open Payments Help Desk but a solution could not be reached. To ensure a complete submission, we submitted the products in question as Medical Supplies and added contextual information to each impacted record."

BioMarin has matched each covered recipient to the VPL/NPPL via the respective NPI number, and, where applicable, BioMarin has reflected the physician's corresponding first name, last name, taxonomy code and one SLN from the VPL/NPPL in the General Payments report.- If a covered recipient was not found on the VPL/NPPL, then the corresponding recipient information from the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (""NPPES"") database was used to enrich recipient data from the BioMarin data sources. As such, BioMarin has matched each covered recipient to NPPES via the NPI number, and, where applicable, BioMarin has reflected the covered recipient's corresponding first name, last name, taxonomy code and one SLN from NPPES in the General Payments report.- For instances where BioMarin is unable to find a valid match for a covered recipient on the VPL/NPPL and NPPES, BioMarin used the state license information for the individual from state medical license databases.- Covered recipients who are submitted in the General Payments report, but are not accepted by the CMS system after reasonable attempts are made to modify the data (based on CMS guidance / error logs) will be documented and removed from the system (e.g., Recipients who are identified as ""Residents"", but an active SLN has been found in State License Boards)- For healthcare institutions that received a transfer of value (""TOV"") in 2023, BioMarin used the tax ID recorded in BioMarin data sources to match against the CMS 2023 Teaching Hospital List. If a match was not found, then the transaction was not included in the General Payments report. If a matching tax ID was found, then the corresponding institution name and address were reflected in the General Payments report. In instances where multiple matching records on the Teaching Hospital List were found, BioMarin analyzed the institution name and address listed on the Teaching Hospital List to identify the corresponding entry to be reflected in the General Payments report.- For educational items, such as journal reprints, the transfer of value amount is based on the acquisition cost of the reprint for the given period, excluding shipping and other related administrative costs.- TOVs for publication support activities that are deemed reportable, not pursuant to a research agreement, will be based on the average costs across publication types for 2023. The methodology to report the publication support activities will be consistent with a singular nature of payment which BioMarin has determined as Consulting Fee. - As publication support TOVs were based on the average cost across publication types for 2023, the reported TOV date will be December 31, 2023. This reflects the publication costs for the entire year. - Given the updated average cost methodology to calculate the publication support in program year 2023, no unique products were reported for 2023 publication support. - BioMarin reports TOVs to covered recipient Board of Directors during the period. The physicians on the Board of Directors with TOVs during the 2023 Program Year are Willard Dere and Dennis Slamon.- BioMarin will report one associated product name as follows:- If the TOV is general in nature and is related to at least one marketed product, then BioMarin has listed the brand or trade name of the marketed product.- If the TOV is related to a product that has not yet been approved by the FDA, then the ""Non-Covered Product"" designation has been used.Research Payments:- BioMarin tracks certain information for each given covered and non-covered recipient entity (e.g., research site) and covered recipient principal investigator, including:- For covered recipient principal investigator: Name, address, credential and at least the NPI number or one SLN; and- For covered and non-covered recipient entities: Name, address, and tax ID.- BioMarin used CMS's latest VPL/NPPL to enrich covered recipient information. BioMarin has matched each covered recipient from its data sources to the VPL/NPPL via the respective NPI number and, where applicable, BioMarin has reflected the physician's corresponding first name, last name, taxonomy code, and one SLN from the VPL/NPPL in the Research report.- If a covered recipient was not found on the CMS VPL/NPPL, then the corresponding recipient information from the NPPES database was used to enrich recipient data from the BioMarin data sources.  As such, BioMarin has matched each covered recipient from its data sources to NPPES via the respective NPI number and, where applicable, BioMarin has reflected the physician's corresponding first name, last name, taxonomy code, and one SLN from NPPES in the Research report.- For instances where BioMarin is unable to find a valid match for a covered recipient on the CMS VPL/NPPL and NPPES, BioMarin used the state license information for the individual from the respective state medical license database.

The company is registered and submitting its report as GlaxoSmithKline LLC, GSK, and all payments and other transfers of value (POTVs), are attributed to GSK. This report, as submitted to CMS, includes verified data in GSKs system that represents reportable POTVs provided to Covered Recipients (CRs) during the reporting period. Data that enters GSKs system or is verified after this submission will be assessed to determine if it impacts this submission. As necessary, GSK will submit corrected and or updated information. GSK determined a CR status at the time it prepared the data for submission to CMS. GSK policy prohibits payment to CRs for authorship activities associated with development of scientific publications. Consistent with industry standard, GSK occasionally engages third parties to provide operational support for scientific publications or pays journal submission and publication fees to ensure that data from GSK sponsored studies is timely published. There are different interpretations within the industry on whether such spend represents reportable POTVs to CR authors. GSK has identified POTVs that can be associated with support to authors for publication and, per publication and according to detailed invoices total TOV for in scope activities is apportioned equally across all authors and reported with respect to each HCP author. TOV is assigned and calculated for each named author on the submitted publication. For POTVs associated with GSK sponsored studies, GSK does not report the value associated with equipment, study compounds, and other materials provided to a CR under the rationale that such materials are provided solely for purposes of performing the research for which GSK has engaged the CR and because they are either required to be passed on to study participants for free or, if not used, returned to GSK. For purposes of GSK supported studies, studies initiated by research institutions and investigators for which GSK provides support in the form of in kind or monetary grants, GSK reports the value of materials that it provides, except for non-marketed compound provided for non-clinical studies, under the rationale that the CR is not providing a service to GSK. A limited number of GSK employees are licensed health care professionals who may take part in clinical practice in settings beyond the scope of their GSK responsibilities (e.g., pro bono services) and in so doing are transparent with the clinic and with patients under their care that they are employed by GSK.

",No ,No ,No ,No ,No ,No ,Yes ,0,0,1088,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Indirect Payments- CMS defined an ""indirect payment"" as a payment or other transfer of value made by a manufacturer to a physician or teaching hospital through a third party or intermediary, in which the manufacturer ""requires, instructs, directs or otherwise causes"" the third party to provide payment or transfer of value, in whole or in part, to a physician or teaching hospital.- Two conditions must both be met for an indirect payment to be subject to reporting, which requires a case-by-case analysis:1. Did the applicable manufacturer make an ""indirect payment""; and2. Did the applicable manufacturer know the identity of the covered recipient in the applicable period?- If the answer to both of these questions is yes, then Phathom Pharmaceuticals (hereinafter referred to as ""Phathom"") shall report the arrangement or activity as an indirect payment.  - Any references to indirect payments in this Assumptions document are based on the above ""indirect payments"" definition.3rd Party Payments- Phathom reports any payments as a transfer of value to the physician in the event the physician requests that his/her fees be paid to another third-party entity or individual.   - Phathom also receives requests for research or grant funding from teaching hospitals signed by the physician who will oversee the particular research or project referenced in the request.  Phathom reports these transactions as payments to the teaching hospital as the teaching hospital receives the payment and Phathom reasonably assumes that physicians are acting on behalf of the teaching hospital.  Addresses - Phathom reports the address to which the payment or transfer of value was sent to the covered recipient.   In the event an address is not provided in connection with a transaction, Phathom uses the address for the covered recipient found in Phathom Pharmaceutical's internal customer management system.  Identifying Teaching Hospitals- Phathom uses the annual CMS List of teaching hospitals to identify whether an entity is a teaching hospital.  - Payments made to an entity that is affiliated with a teaching hospital will be analyzed under the indirect payment rules.Identifying and Assessing Payments or Transfers of ""Value""- Phathom has adopted a two-step methodology for establishing value for purposes of reporting:o Phathom determines if an item provided to a covered recipient has a ""discernible economic value on the open market."" o If the item has a discernible economic value on the open market, Phathom will calculate the value to be reported.  Dates of Payment- For a series of payments or other transfers of value made under a research protocol or agreement during the reporting year, Phathom reports a single value, dated with the first payment or other transfer of value made during that year.- For payments and in-kind items given directly to covered recipients, Phathom will date the transaction with the date of the payment or transfer.- For indirect payments or transfers of value to covered recipients, Phathom dates these transactions with the later of (1) the date on which a third party provided the payment to the covered recipient or (2) the date of any event to which the payment relates.Charitable Contributions- Phathom supports fundraising activities of IRS 501(c)(3) organizations. These funding activities are typically considered as sponsorships under Phathom Pharmaceutical's policy.- Phathom will report charitable contributions if the non-profit is a covered recipient.Consulting Fee- Phathom hires covered recipients to serve on advisory boards or to advise the company on commercial or medical / scientific issues.  Phathom reasonably assumes that compensation for these covered recipients should be reported as Consulting payments.  Compensation for Services Other than Consulting - Phathom reports transfers of value to covered recipients for research-related services that do not meet the definition of research as compensation for services other than consulting.Education- Phathom values reprints based on a weighted average of its costs to acquire and print the reprints it distributes to all recipients.  - Phathom adds its licensing, postage, tax, and printing costs for all the reprints it distributed to all recipients in the prior year, and divides that amount by the total number reprints it distributed to all recipients in that year.  - Phathom will choose ""education"" as the nature of payment when reporting the value of reprints.  Educational Materials Exemption - Phathom does not report brochures, pamphlets, or other written promotional or marketing materials.  Accredited-CME-Related Payments - Phathom will not report any contributions to a third party to support a bona fide continuing medical education (CME) program in which Phathom  has no control or influence in determining the content, speakers, or attendees.- Phathom will not report any tuition fees provided to physician attendees that have been generally subsidized at CME events.- Phathom will not track or report speakers' fees, food, lodging or transportation because Phathom has no direct or indirect influence or control with respect to the content, faculty, speakers, or attendees of the CME program.Grant- Phathom provides medical education grants to bona fide educational programs that fill a scientific and educational need in therapeutic areas of interest to Phathom.  Phathom will report funding for educational programs done as a sponsorship where Phathom receives only corporate recognition under the grant nature of payment category.  Meals- For a meal that is not separately identifiable, Phathom will calculate the ""Per Person Value of the Meal"" by dividing the entire cost of the meal by the total number of individuals who ate the meal.  Review of a sign-in sheet for an event sometimes identifies additional attendees who were not previously identified or included in Phathom Pharmaceutical's calculations of meal values.  (This review occurs before submission of payment information to CMS.)  - Where food and beverage may be provided to covered recipients in a buffet format or as hors d'oeuvres, Phathom will only attribute value to those physicians who actually attend and partake in the meal.  The value shall be the overall cost of the meal divided by the total number of invited or expected attendees.- Phathom will not track and report buffet meals, coffee, snacks or similar small items provided at a large-scale meeting or conference (more than 100 attendees) where such items are available to all meeting attendees and it would be difficult to definitively identify who actually partook in the snacks or coffee. Travel and Expenses for Consultants- Physician speakers and other physician consultants who provide services to Phathom sometimes request expense reimbursement for expenses under $25 without an itemized receipt.  For these expenses, Phathom will report the transfers of value under the Travel and Lodging category.   Space Rental or Facility Fees - From time-to-time Phathom pays sponsorship fees to teaching hospitals in exchange for use of exhibit space, signage, and other corporate promotional activities at teaching hospital events.  Phathom reports these payments as space rental or facility fees.Submission of Transactions that Do Not Match CMS's Physician Database- The Open Payments system will not accept data involving physician covered recipients that CMS is not able to identify/match with its physician database.  - Phathom reviews the covered recipients and performs various steps to ensure the validated fields in the data are consistent with the data utilized by CMS for validation.  - Phathom will maintain a record of the transactions that are not accepted by the CMS system due to CMS's inability to match the Phathom-submitted data with the CMS physician list."

In addition, CMS has acknowledged that it is not able to identify all U.S. covered recipients to whom manufacturers have furnished reportable payments or other transfers of value during the reporting period. JP has made good faith efforts to timely submit records via the Open Payments system that are associated with covered recipients who it believes are covered recipients, but which CMS has been unable to match. Despite our efforts, the Open Payments system will not accept those records.

(Skeletal Dynamics) uses its best knowledge of providers and the credentials under which they practice to determine which providers are reportable as covered recipients as defined under 42 C.F.R. & 403.902.2. Once a covered recipient is identified, Skeletal Dynamics will report the associated transfers of value (TOV) for the entire year for that covered recipient.  If an individual becomes a covered recipient during the reportable year, any TOV for the entire year available to and accessible by Skeletal Dynamics at the time of reporting will be reported.  3. Dates for cash TOVs to covered recipients will be reported as the date the payment was made.  Dates for payments made with corporate American Express credit cards will be reported as the dates the charges were incurred.  Dates for meals and refreshments will be reported as the dates the associated events took place.4. The reporting template allows for listing of up to 5 products per payment.  Beginning in 2021, when more than 5 products are associated with a payment, Skeletal Dynamics will provide the first 5 products in alphabetical order.  Prior to 2021, Skeletal Dynamics listed products based on an assessment of which were most relevant to the covered recipient's activity, with the most relevant products being listed first.5. Skeletal Dynamics reports all devices by the product marketed or brand name.6. Payments to a teaching hospital and payments that benefit a teaching hospital will be reported when the recipient party tax ID number and/or the recipient teaching hospital name and address match a covered recipient on the CMS teaching hospital list for that reportable year.7. Valuations for educational reprints are based on the cost to Skeletal Dynamics to obtain the reprints.8. Prior to 2020, Skeletal Dynamics had concluded that interest payments made to covered recipients for loans unsecured and subordinated to Skeletal Dynamics's operating line of credit were not required to be reported through Open Payments since the regulations exclude from the definition of ownership or investment interests unsecured loans subordinated to a credit facility and because there is no reporting category for interest on a loan.  42 CFR && 403.902, 403.904.  Skeletal Dynamics considered interest on the loan to be a return to the covered recipient lender of the covered recipient's unreportable investment interest.  In connection with its 2020 filing, Skeletal Dynamics has reconsidered this conclusion and going forward will be reporting such interest payments as TOVs.  Skeletal Dynamics will also be revising its disclosures from prior years to account for this change in methodology. 9. Skeletal Dynamics seeks information quarterly from its US distributors regarding TOVs made by the distributors to covered recipients. Prior to 2020, Skeletal Dynamics reported the TOVS disclosed to it by its US distributors through Open Payments, and some TOVs so-reported may not have had any Skeletal Dynamics involvement.  In connection with its 2020 filing, Skeletal Dynamics has reconsidered this conclusion and going forward will be reporting TOVs to covered recipients made by its US distributors only when Skeletal Dynamics requires, instructs, directs, or otherwise causes the distributor to provide the TOV, in whole or in part, to the covered recipient, consistent with 42 CFR & 403.904(a).10. Supplies and materials that are considered to be of de minimis value are not tracked by Skeletal Dynamics's vendors and will not be included in the report.11. Where a physician NPI and/or license number cannot be found using NPPES or a state licensure database, Skeletal Dynamics will contact the person to whom the payment was made as well as his or her office.  In the event that Skeletal Dynamics is not able to obtain the information through these means and thus cannot fill in the NPI and/or licensure fields in the report, Open Payments does not allow the reporting of a TOV; accordingly, Skeletal Dynamics will not report the associated TOV but will maintain an internal record of the TOV and the efforts made to obtain the NPI and/or license number information.12. Skeletal Dynamics's general payments and research report includes all information required to be reported pursuant to the Sunshine Act, which is available to and accessible by Skeletal Dynamics at the time of reporting.  It is possible that certain errors and omissions may exist in the reported information due to circumstances beyond Skeletal Dynamics's direct control.  These circumstances may include, but are not limited to, delays in receipt of the reportable data, missing or irretrievable data, and/or data omitted from information that is provided by vendors or other necessary sources of information."

Additionally, CMS has acknowledged that the Validated Lists are not an exhaustive listing of U.S. covered recipients, and the Validated Lists in fact do not include all covered recipients to whom the Company furnished reportable payments or other transfers of value during the reporting period.  The Company has made good faith efforts to timely submit records via the Open Payments system that are associated with covered recipients who are not on the Validated Lists, and which CMS has been otherwise unable to match, but the system may not be able to accept them because of the inability to match the records.

All other payments are categorized as ""Non-Research."" In cases where a payment has characteristics of both research and non-research, we have used our best judgment to categorize the payment based on the primary purpose.Educational Events: The cost of educational events attended by covered recipients is reported based on the total expenses incurred by the company for the event, divided by the number of attendees.Physician Payments: We have used reasonable efforts to identify and report payments made to physicians, including payments made to third-party entities on behalf of physicians. However, we may not be able to identify all payments to physicians if the information provided at the time of payment is incomplete or inaccurate.Data Validation:We have performed internal data validation procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the reported data.

1E+11,Pfizer International LLC ,No ,No ,No ,No ,Yes ,Yes ,Yes ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"This Pfizer Inc. ('Pfizer') submission reflects its commitment and good faith efforts to comply with the Sunshine Act ('Act'). Pfizer is fully committed to complying with the letter as well as the spirit of the Act.  Pfizer has sophisticated, comprehensive and exhaustive processes and quality controls designed to ensure the complete and timely submission of reportable transactions. To prepare this submission, Pfizer relied upon internal sources such as automated systems, standardized processes and manual data entry. Pfizer also relied on the cooperation and reporting from third parties whose data sources Pfizer does not have any control over. By company policy and contract, Pfizer obligates its employees and third parties to provide it with complete and accurate data regarding payments or transfers-of-value to Covered Recipients. Pfizer regularly monitors and audits compliance with relevant policies, processes, systems, and data-entry requirements. Pfizer assesses any deficiencies identified and implements corrective measures as appropriate. These efforts underscore Pfizer's commitment to preventing potential deficiencies in its systems and processes to the extent they can be identified or prevented. Despite these efforts there were several areas where corrections to the data are required.  a. Matching Validation Rule: Pfizer is following the guidance CMS provided and is forwarding all records that failed matching validation to the CMS Help Desk.  b. Unassociated Credits: Open Payments prevents Pfizer from reporting associated credits. Pfizer is following the guidance CMS provided and has attempted to match debits and credits. However, there are situations where there is a partial credit or the associated debit was in a previous year, and therefore could not be matched. c. Data Adjustments: Adjustments to previously attested data are required to ensure that the latest and most accurate data is provided to CMS and ultimately disclosed to the public.

The company is registered and submitting its report as ViiV Healthcare Company, and all payments and other transfers of value (POTVs), are attributed to VHC. VHC outsources its financial system management and reporting services to its majority shareholder, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and has relied upon GSK to identify the PTOVs within the scope of the report. To the best of VHC's knowledge, the report submitted includes the information required to be reported. This report, as submitted to CMS, includes verified data in VHCs system that represents reportable POTVs provided to Covered Recipients (CRs) during the reporting period. Data that enters VHCs system or is verified after this submission will be assessed to determine if it impacts this submission. As necessary, VHC will submit corrected and or updated information. VHC determined a CR status at the time it prepared the data for submission to CMS. VHC policy prohibits payment to CRs for authorship activities associated with development of scientific publications. Consistent with industry standard, VHC occasionally engages third parties to provide operational support for scientific publications or pays journal submission and publication fees to ensure that data from VHC sponsored studies is timely published. There are different interpretations within the industry on whether such spend represents reportable POTVs to CR authors. VHC has identified POTVs that can be associated with support to authors for publication and, per publication and according to detailed invoices total TOV for in scope activities is apportioned equally across all authors and reported with respect to each CR author. TOV is assigned and calculated for each named author on the submitted publication. For POTVs associated with VHC sponsored studies, VHC does not report the value associated with equipment, study compounds, and other materials provided to a CR under the rationale that such materials are provided solely for purposes of performing the research for which VHC has engaged the CR and because they are either required to be passed on to study participants for free or, if not used, returned to VHC. For purposes of VHC supported studies, studies initiated by research institutions and investigators for which VHC provides support in the form of in kind or monetary grants, VHC reports the value of materials that it provides, except for non-marketed compound provided for non-clinical studies, under the rationale that the CR is not providing a service to VHC. A limited number of VHC employees are licensed health care professionals who may take part in clinical practice in settings beyond the scope of their VHC responsibilities (e.g., pro bono services) and in so doing are transparent with the clinic and with patients under their care that they are employed by VHC. VHC was unable to submit records on CMS error file reference 170607. VHC will resubmit once further guidance is provided by CMS."

Gore and Associates, Inc. provides the following explanations for our methodologies and considerations underlying its report, and to complete the required attestation. As provided in the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, Gore is attesting to the timeliness, accuracy and completeness of its submitted data based on these rationales.A. Reporting of Transfers of Value Related to ReprintsGore understands that the Act requires reporting the value of all reprints provided to physician covered recipients.  Gore provides reprints to physicians for educational purposes, referred to as on-label reprints, and in response to physician inquiries in compliance with the FDA Good Reprint Practices, referred to as off-label reprints. As Gore implemented its systems for reporting under the Act, Gore could not identify a practical and accurate method to track the on-label reprints provided and accurately assign exact values to individual Covered Recipients.  As a result, Gore did not track the value of on-label reprints for the 2023 Data Reporting Period, January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023.Gore tracked the value of off-label reprints provided to requesting physicians.  These transfers of value are included in the Gore general payments disclosure for the 2023 Data Reporting Period.B. Submitted Records that Failed the CMS Matching ValidationGore submitted records that cannot be verified by the Open Payments identity matching and verification process. Gore believes that these records are accurate and reflect payments and other transfers of value that would be considered reportable under the Act. Every reasonable effort was made to submit accurate and complete data, but these records continue to fail validation.Because final submission and attestation cannot be completed with records in a state of failed validation, Gore has followed the guidance offered in a CMS update dated March 20, 2015, and deleted all records with a status of Failed Matching Validation. Gore has documented and maintained these records and they can be resubmitted once the Open Payments system is equipped to accept them.C.
